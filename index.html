                </h2>
                <p>
                    Musa I (c. 1280 – c. 1337) or Mansa Musa was the tenth Mansa, which translates to <q>sultan</q>, <q>conqueror</q>, or <q>emperor</q>, of the wealthy West African Islamic Mali Empire.<br> Musa held many titles, including <q>Emir of Melle</q>,
                    <q>Lord of the Mines of Wangara</q>, <q>Conqueror of Ghanata</q>, and at least a dozen others. Mansa Musa conquered 24 cities, each with surrounding districts containing villages and estates. During his reign, Mali may have been the largest producer
                    of gold in the
                    world. He is known to have been enormously wealthy, reported as being inconceivably rich by contemporaries. Time magazine reported: <cite><q>There's really no way to put an accurate number on his wealth.</q></cite>

                Here's a time line of Emperor Musa Keita's life:

                <li>
                    Born sometime around the year 1280 A.D.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 1312 Musa became emperor following the death of his predecessor, Abu-Bakr II. When he was crowned, he was given the name Mansa.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 1324 Musa began his pilgrimage with a entourage of thousands of escorts. He also brought considerable amounts of gold, some of which was distributed along the journey.<br>On his stop in Cairo, Egypt, the Emperor gave out so much gold that
                    he generated a brief decline in its value. Cairo’s gold market recovered over a decade later.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mansa Musa died in 1337 after a twenty-five year reign. He was succeeded by his son, Maghan I.
